<a id="objectives" class="anchor" href="#objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objectives</h3>

<p>Numerous organizations recognize the need to propagate a trace context throughout their (distributed) polyglot systems, including web and mobile clients. Designing these instrumentation libraries is subtle, and nobody wants to absorb the front-loaded cost of adding instrumentation only to be tightly coupled to a particular tracing implementation.</p>

<p>The OpenTracing project provides a multi-lingual standard for application-level instrumentation that's loosely coupled to any particular downstream tracing or monitoring system. In this way, adding or switching tracing implementations becomes an O(1) code change.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Distributed-Context-Propagation-RGvlvD1NFKYmrJG9vGCES">a slightly-out-of-date initial proposal</a> that led directly to OpenTracing.</p>

<h3>
<a id="terminology" class="anchor" href="#terminology" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Terminology</h3>

<p>A <strong>Trace</strong> represents the potentially distributed, potentially concurrent datapath in a (potentially distributed, potentially concurrent) system.</p>

<p>A <strong>Span</strong> represents a logical unit of work in the system that has a start time and an end time. Spans can be nested and ordered to model parent-child and casual relationships. A Trace can be thought of as a tree of Spans. Every Span has zero or more <strong>Logs</strong>, each of which being a timestamped message with an optional payload.</p>

<p>A <strong>Trace Context</strong> encapsulates the smallest amount of state needed to describe a Span's identity within a larger, potentially distributed trace, sufficient to propagate the context of a particular trace between processes.</p>

<p><strong>Trace Attributes</strong> are key/value pairs stored in a Trace Context and propagated in-band to all future children Spans. Given a full-stack OpenTracing integration, Trace Attributes enable powerful functionality by transparently propagating arbitrary application data; e.g., from a mobile app all the way into the depths of a storage system. It comes with powerful <em>costs</em> as well, since the attributes are propagated in-band, alongside the application data; use Trace Attributes with care.</p>

<h3>
<a id="language-support" class="anchor" href="#language-support" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Language Support</h3>

<p>The OpenTracing project aims to provide APIs for all popular platforms. The APIs have standard semantic capabilities and must not be tightly coupled to any particular downstream tracing or monitoring system (Zipkin, etc). Our initial target languages are Go, Python, Java, and Javascript, with more to follow.</p>
