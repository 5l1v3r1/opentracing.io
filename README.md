## Testing localling with Jekyll

See https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/

or, as a crush course:

* make sure Ruby version 2.0.0 or greater is installed
* install Jekyll: `sudo gem install jekyll`
* run the webserver: `jekyll serve` 
* check results: `open http://localhost:4000`

Tips:
* Jekyll will regenerate the site as you update the files, unless you edit `_config.yml`, which requires a restart of `jekyll serve`
