Designing these instrumentation libraries is subtle, and nobody wants to absorb the front-loaded cost of adding instrumentation only to be tightly coupled to a particular tracing implementation.\r\n\r\nThe OpenTracing project provides a multi-lingual standard for application-level instrumentation that's loosely coupled to any particular downstream tracing or monitoring system. In this way, adding or switching tracing implementations becomes an O(1) code change.\r\n\r\nThere is [a slightly-out-of-date initial proposal](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Distributed-Context-Propagation-RGvlvD1NFKYmrJG9vGCES) that led diriectly to the OpenTracing project.### Assumptions\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors (in alphabetical order)\r\nAdrian Cole (@adriancole), Ben Sigelman (@bensigelman), Stephen Gutekanst (@slimsag), Yuri Shkuro (@yurishkuro)\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nOpen an issue against one of the repositories, or start a discussion in [Distributed Tracing](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distributed-tracing) Google group.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
